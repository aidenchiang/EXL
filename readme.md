# EXL
The following project is something I worked on during the 2022 summer as part of my internship at Rensaissance Learning.

It analyzes the relationships between a K-12 student's socioeconomic background and their achievenment in schools.

I would like to give special thanks to Jon Stelman for not only running the EXL program but also helping guide me immensely on this project.

### CSV Files
These are the two files the progrom analyses and uses to train a model. One of them was too large to upload on GitHub so I instead choose to include links to them here.

- https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=5014491&version=3.0 (File was renamed to "harvard_SAT_income" for the project).
